# Cross Project Survey Invite
After saving a field with comma separated email addresses, create records in another project and email survey invites.

### Explanation of module settings:
**"List of Projects to Pipe To"** - All settings of the module are repeatable under this heading. Each project that needs to have survey invitations generated should be set up separately under this heading.<br>
**"Field With Comma Separated List of Emails (either text or CSV file field)"** - A list of email addresses to send survey invitations. This can either be a plain text list of comma separated emails, or a file field containing a normal comma separated text file (.csv).<br>
**"Field With Email Address to Send Emails From"** - This should be the email address you want people to see as the sender of the email. Please use a valid '@vumc.org' email address. 'noreply@vumc.org' or any non-'vumc.org' email address will potentially be blocked by a recipient's mail server.<br>
